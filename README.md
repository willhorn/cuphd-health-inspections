# CUPHD Health Inspections

## Background

I am a former resident of Champaign-Urbana. While residing there, I became aware of the publicly available health inspection reports provided by the Champaign Urbana Public Health District. Since then I've wanted to do something with that data. These are my efforts.

## Data

My first goal with this project is to pull health inspection report data. For that I'm using [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html).
